#### Social media assistance services (IG & FB): R2000pm.

My job is to make running your social media easier & implement my marketing strategy, not run it completely. The account is still yours, you just won't have to worry about it anymore as I will be maintaining your digital presence every week. 

Includes:

* Free access to my content (photos & short videos).
* Weekly posting with caption & hashtags, 5 days a week.

Note: I will not reply to comments, only like them, I will not reply to DM's & I will seldomly post to your story.
