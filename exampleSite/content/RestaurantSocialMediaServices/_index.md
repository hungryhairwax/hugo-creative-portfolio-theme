FOR RESTAURANTS ONLY

_Imagine one day, one of your followers wants to eat out. They think "where should eat?" & immediately your brand pops into their mind. Why? It might be because they've been blasted by your high-quality-educational content every day for the past month!_

***

My job is to make managing your social media account easier & maintain your digital presence. You get:

* 20 pieces of content every month (photos & videos) with custom captions & hashtags for Facebook & Instagram.
* 24/7 contact and support from me.
* Album creation for media outlets like online magazines/ award-giving brands.
* My constant monitoring of your social media accounts & online presence.
